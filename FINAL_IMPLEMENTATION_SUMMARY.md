## ‚úÖ Phase 2: V2 Blueprint - Advanced Analytics

### 2.1 Learning Effectiveness (Retention Rate with Maturity Breakdown)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete  
**Component:** `RetentionRateChart` (Enhanced)  
**API:** `src/app/api/revision-hub/retention-rate/route.ts`

**Features Implemented:**
- **Circular progress indicator** - Overall retention rate visualization
- **Maturity-based table** - 4-cell breakdown:
  - Young Questions (< 21 days) √ó Last 7 Days
  - Young Questions (< 21 days) √ó Last 30 Days  
  - Mature Questions (‚â• 21 days) √ó Last 7 Days
  - Mature Questions (‚â• 21 days) √ó Last 30 Days
- **"N/A" handling** - Displays when insufficient data for category
- **Enhanced tooltip** - Explains maturity classification and targets
- **Average Ease Factor** - Proactive addition for context
- **Color-coded feedback** - Visual performance indicators

**Backend Logic:**
- Queries `review_history` table for last 30 days
- Categorizes by maturity (interval_at_review)
- Calculates success rate (rating >= 3 = Good/Easy)
- Filters by time windows (7 days vs 30 days)

### 2.2 Hourly Performance Breakdown
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete  
**Component:** Added to `ActionableInsightsCard`  
**API:** `src/app/api/revision-hub/hourly-performance/route.ts`

**Features Implemented:**
- **4 time block analysis:**
  - Morning (6:00 AM - 11:59 AM)
  - Afternoon (12:00 PM - 5:59 PM)
  - Evening (6:00 PM - 11:59 PM)
  - Night (12:00 AM - 5:59 AM)
- **Animated horizontal bar chart** - Success rate visualization
- **Color-coded performance** - Green (‚â•80%), Blue (‚â•60%), Yellow (<60%)
- **Interactive hover tooltips** - Shows exact stats per time block
- **Empty state** - Displays when < 3 time blocks have data
- **Actionable tip** - Encourages scheduling during peak times

**Backend Logic:**
- Fetches user's timezone from `user_notification_preferences`
- Converts UTC timestamps to local timezone
- Aggregates reviews by time block
- Calculates success rate per block
- Enforces minimum data threshold (3+ blocks)

### 2.3 Review History Infrastructure
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete  
**Database:** `review_history` table  
**Schema:** `review-history-schema.sql`

**Table Structure:**
- Tracks every SRS review with full historical context
- Captures SRS state at time of review (for maturity classification)
- Captures SRS state after review (for analytics)
- Includes performance rating (1-4 scale)
- Proper indexing for query performance

**Integration:**
- `log-review/route.ts` updated to populate on every review
- Non-blocking insertion (won't fail main request)
- Powers both retention rate and hourly performance features

## üéØ Success Metrics Achieved

Users can now answer all critical questions:

‚úÖ **"Is my studying working?"**  
   ‚Üí Via retention rate maturity table showing Young vs Mature recall

‚úÖ **"When am I most effective?"**  
   ‚Üí Via hourly performance breakdown chart identifying peak study times

‚úÖ **"How do I compare Young vs Mature recall?"**  
   ‚Üí Via side-by-side 7-day and 30-day retention comparison

‚úÖ **"What should I focus on?"**  
   ‚Üí Via hardest questions and weakest chapters sections

‚úÖ **"What's coming up this month?"**  
   ‚Üí Via interactive monthly calendar with scheduled reviews

‚úÖ **"How consistent am I?"**  
   ‚Üí Via 90-day activity heatmap and streak counters

## üöÄ Key Technical Achievements

1. **Timezone-Aware Analytics** - Proper UTC to user timezone conversion
2. **Non-Blocking Architecture** - Analytics failures don't crash dashboard
3. **Type-Safe Integration** - Full TypeScript coverage across stack
4. **Performance Optimized** - Strategic indexing on review_history table
5. **Scalable Design** - Efficient queries with proper WHERE clauses
6. **Dark Mode Support** - All components fully themed
7. **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
8. **Empty State Handling** - Graceful degradation when data insufficient
9. **Interactive Visualizations** - Click, hover, and animation effects
10. **Data-Driven Insights** - Real calculations, not estimates

## üìù Database Setup Instructions

To complete the deployment, run the SQL schema on your Supabase database:

```bash
psql -h <your-supabase-host> -U postgres -d postgres -f review-history-schema.sql
```

**Note:** Once the `review_history` table is created, the system will automatically start populating it with every new SRS review. Historical data will accumulate over time.

---

## üêõ Bugs Fixed

### Critical SQL Error
**Issue:** Actionable Insights card was failing with 500 error  
**Root Cause:** SQL query referenced `questions_1.chapter` instead of `questions_1.chapter_name`  
**Impact:** Blocked rendering of Hardest Questions, Weakest Chapters, AND Hourly Performance  
**Fix Applied:** Updated all references from `chapter` to `chapter_name`  
**Result:** All three sections now render correctly

### UI Polish Updates
1. Removed borders from streak cards for cleaner design
2. Modernized notification bell and dropdown styling
3. Enhanced note card with premium gradient and glass morphism
4. Added retention rate tooltip to monthly calendar
