## üé® Design Decisions

### Modal Layout
- **Width:** 672px (max-w-2xl) - optimal for readability without overwhelming
- **Height:** Max 90vh with overflow-y-auto for mobile compatibility
- **Z-index:** 50 for main modal, 60 for nested confirmation modal
- **Padding:** 6 units (24px) - compact but not cramped

### Color Scheme
- **Primary Actions:** Blue-to-purple gradients (matching app theme)
- **Settings Icon:** Slate (subtle, non-distracting)
- **Confirmation:** Amber/yellow for warning states
- **Success/Error:** Green/red for feedback messages

### Typography
- **Modal Title:** text-xl font-bold (compact header)
- **Section Titles:** text-lg font-semibold
- **Body Text:** text-sm for descriptions
- **Labels:** text-xs for secondary info

### Spacing Strategy
- **Between Sections:** gap-6 (24px) with border divider
- **Within Sections:** gap-4 (16px) for related elements
- **Button Groups:** gap-2 or gap-3 for tight clusters
